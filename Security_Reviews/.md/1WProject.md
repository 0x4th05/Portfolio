# Protocol Summary

The One World Project leverages blockchain technology to revolutionize global capital markets. By democratizing access to funding and resources, we empower communities, foster economic growth, and create sustainable financial opportunities worldwide.

One World Project is a dynamic DAO marketplace where users can actively participate in decentralized organizations. This repository contains smart contracts for creating and managing DAO memberships using ERC1155 tokens. The contracts facilitate the creation and management of DAO memberships. Each DAO membership is represented by an ERC1155 token with different tiers.

# Disclaimer
A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where I try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. I can not guarantee 100% security after the review or even if the review will find any problems with your smart contracts. Subsequent security reviews, bug bounty programs and on-chain monitoring are strongly recommended.

# Scope

## MembershipFactory

 - Create New DAO Membership: Deploys a new proxy contract for the DAO membership.
 - Update DAO Membership: Updates the tier configurations for a specific DAO.
 - Join DAO: Allows a user to join a DAO by purchasing a membership NFT at a specific tier.
 - Upgrade Tier: Allows users to upgrade their tier within a sponsored DAO.
 - Set Currency Manager: Updates the currency manager contract.
 - Call External Contract: Allows the factory to perform external calls to other contracts.

## MembershipERC1155

 - Initialize: Initializes the contract with the name, symbol, URI, and creator address.
 - Mint Tokens: Mints new tokens.
 - Burn Tokens: Burns existing tokens.
 - Claim Profit: Allows users to claim profits from the profit pool.
 - Send Profit: Distributes profits to token holders.
 - Call External Contract: Allows the contract to perform external calls to other contracts.â€‹

# Findings


## [L1] Missing currency check when joining a DAO leading to potential loss of profits and protocol fees

**Relevant GitHub Links**
https://github.com/Cyfrin/2024-11-one-world/blob/main/contracts/dao/MembershipFactory.sol#L146-L147

**Summary**
The protocol has implemented some allowed currencies to use its functions to ensure payments are received. However, using `MembershipFactory::joinDAO` no check is made to ensure payments are all made with allowed currencies. (As done using the `MembershipFactory::createNewDAOMembership`)

**Vulnerability Details**
No check made through the `currencyManager::isCurrencyWhitelisted` function when joining a DAO using `MembershipFactory::joinDAO`. 
This because the OG currency could have been removed from the list because the protocol cannot accept that currency anymore. 


**Impact**
As not stated otherwise in the documentation provided it is reasonable to assume that payments made with no `viewWhitelistedCurrencies` could not be received by the contract/wallet causing this way a loss of all the funds.

        require(daos[daoMembershipAddress].noOfTiers > tierIndex, "Invalid tier.");
        require(daos[daoMembershipAddress].tiers[tierIndex].amount > daos[daoMembershipAddress].tiers[tierIndex].minted, "Tier full.");

        uint256 tierPrice = daos[daoMembershipAddress].tiers[tierIndex].price;
        uint256 platformFees = (20 * tierPrice) / 100;
        daos[daoMembershipAddress].tiers[tierIndex].minted += 1;
        IERC20(daos[daoMembershipAddress].currency).transferFrom(_msgSender(), owpWallet, platformFees);
        IERC20(daos[daoMembershipAddress].currency).transferFrom(_msgSender(), daoMembershipAddress, tierPrice - platformFees);

# Protocol Summary

IQ AI built the Agent Tokenization Platform (ATP) to empower developers to launch tokenized AI agents that can own and manage digital and physical assetsâ€”from cryptocurrencies and DeFi strategies to robotics and IoT automation.


# Disclaimer

A smart contract security review can never verify the complete absence of vulnerabilities. This is a time, resource and expertise bound effort where I try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. I can not guarantee 100% security after the review or even if the review will find any problems with your smart contracts. Subsequent security reviews, bug bounty programs and on-chain monitoring are strongly recommended.

# Findings

## [I1] Useless transaction consuming gas fee

**Relevant GitHub Links**

https://github.com/code-423n4/2025-01-iq-ai/blob/main/src/AgentFactory.sol#L116

**Finding description**

```solidity
@>    if (mintToDAOAmount > 0) token.safeTransfer(address(this), mintToDAOAmount);
        if (mintToAgentAmount > 0) token.safeTransfer(address(agent), mintToAgentAmount);
        token.safeTransfer(address(manager), initialLiquidity);
        manager.initializeBootstrapPool();
```
The transfer of the `mintToDAOAmount` is from the `factoryAgent` to the `factoryAgent` itself so it could be removed to use this way less gas in the `createAgent` function.
